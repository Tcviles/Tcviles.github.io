Before enlisting in the military, I was quite the partier. I went to IUPUI and would go party and meet people every single weekend in downtown Indianapois or Broad Ripple. In March of 2013, I finally decided that I needed to get some discipline and focus in my life. So I did the most sensical thing I could,, join the US military!

Luckily I was good at studying a long with my social habits, so I scored a 99% on the ASVAB for the military. I was talked into going into the special forces and unfortunatly did not pass the seleciton process. When I was downgraded to the infantry, I knew I needed to start studying for a permenant career for when I got out. 

I studied a lot of random things, between psychology, physics, mathematics, etc. Problem solving was my real love in everything I dabbled into. I learned how to solve a rubicks cube and became slightly obsessed with any puzzle that was put in my way. I thought I was prepared so when I got out of the military, even I was a little suprised to find an electrician opprotunity waiting for me. 

The electrician gig had nothing to do with problem solving and thinking, as I soon found out. There is nothing wrong with construction work, it was just not what I wanted to do with my life. So while I was working for Shambaugh in Indianapolis, I was working at a data hub for multiple businesses in downtown Indianapolis. I talked to a few of the people that worked in the companies there, and met a few nerdy people like me. 

I forget the name of the companies they worked for, but they were all small start ups and everyone seemed to be having a good time at work. One of the owners of the spaces we were running electricity in told me to check out an app called SoloLearn on android. That is where I found my first programming language in Python. 

I ran through Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript on SoloLearn. All while checking out youtube posts by Simple Programmer, Qazi at Clever Programmer, etc. And downloading other courses thru Udacity and Coursera. This finally led to me shopping for an online bootcamp at a decent price. I knew I wanted to learn Ruby and become more fluent with Javascript. Thinkful, Bloc.io, and Fullstack Academy all seemed like great choices; However, I finally decided on Flatiron due to what seemed like the best learning interface in the Learn IDE. The free bootcamp crash course definitely helped as well!

So there it is, a quick run down from pre-military to Flatiron school student. Thanks for reading!
