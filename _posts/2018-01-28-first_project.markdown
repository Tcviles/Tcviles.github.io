My first project for Flatiron school was building a CLI for my friends website. I plan on taking over his website for his supplement business so I figured it would make a good project subject for me. The CLI is based off of the website AlphaFitnessSupplements.net. 

The CLI starts off with by calling my AlphaSupps::CLI class. It gives a list of categories (Protein, Pre-Workout, Etc.) that you can choose from, and when you choose, it lists the products within that category. The products show the name, type, and price of each product. The type of product was sometimes in the name, so I made sure to use Chomp! to get the type name out of the product name for redundancy reasons. 

Another challenge was getting Nokogiri to work! I learned that GemSpecs need to be filled out in order to use the actual Gems in a project :-D. 

In this project. I finally learned how I will implement my git skills. With learn labs, its easy to forget how to use git since everything seems to be "learn submit" or "learn open". I also feel alot more confident now about scraping. I think more practice will do me good. 

Now I just have to figure out how to upload my video recording! Probably youtube. Thanks for the challenge flatiron! 

If anyone cares to watch the recording,, or a video of me singing a goofy song. Feel free to look up my youtube channel! Thomas Viles on youtube!
