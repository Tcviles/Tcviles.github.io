Over the past few weeks I have been listening to a lot of Grant Cardone, makes me want to become an entrepreneur!

But back to this project. 

Ill be honest, I stole a lot of the structure by looking at previous lessons! (But I learned from somewhere right? I dont call it cheating, I call it researching my notes). 

This project was a lot of fun! My db tables and models were User, Dentist, and Insurance. I plan to build  a functional site for my friend who is graduating Dental school this summer. This was the inspiration for the topic of this project. 

I got stuck on trying to add CSS to my erb, so I will definitely be asking a technical coach how to do this on my review! I did do a little bit of styling with line breaks and h tags, but nothing truely special. 

This lab also finally made me understand the purpose of yeild! Which is a topic that I previously had issues with!!!

This isnt the greatest blog, so I apologize! The video is worse! I hope you like the project! It is on my github at https://github.com/Tcviles/dentist-app
